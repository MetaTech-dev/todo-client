# todo-client

- The front end of a full-stack task-management application, to help you and your team stay productive and organized.

## Getting Started:

- Make sure you have node installed, recommend using nvm.
- run `npm install`.
- run `npm start`.

## Why Does This Exist?

- I built this primarily as a full-stack portfolio project to demonstrate my knowledge of CRUD, authentication/authorization, etc. The goal was to build a visually appealing application that was immediately understandable to the end-user. Every feature started out as being built from scratch while enjoying the niceties of Material UI's library. As complexities and needs grew, if appropriate, I incorporated a third-party library (such as TanStack Query, Clerk, etc). There are other common libraries/tools that I dont believe this app has grown to the point of needing yet, but might get incorporated in the future.
